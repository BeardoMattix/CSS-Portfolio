# Homework Week-2

## Description
For this assignment I wanted to create a portfolio that utilzed the css and html skills we were taught in class. I was motivated to create something that looked professional and performed well. I also wanted the layout to look good and perform well on screens of different sizes. I used flexbox, css variables, and media queries to accomplish my design. I built this project to test my css skills and so I could have a web application that I can keep working on as I learn more in class. 

I struggled for a while trying to figure out how to best use the flexbox properties from class in my design. While I don't think this is a perfect example of the power of flexbox, I am satisfied with the outcome and want to continue practicing so I can be more proficient and create better and more responsive web applications. 

Media queries were used to reformat the page at different break points. This was also a bit of a struggle, and I think designing for a mobile platform first would have saved me some headaches in the long run. 

I learned a lot during this assignment; how to create multiple sections on a page that use flexbox, how to create a vertical line that divides the page, and how to consolidate css styles for multiple elements. I also learned that you can easily spend hours on one element and then change your mind and redo the whole thing. 

## Problems Solved:
The problems solved by this assignment are:
* Created a place for potential employers to learn about me.
* Created landing page/portfolio to house my work.
